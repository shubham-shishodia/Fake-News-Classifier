# Fake News Classification using a simple Naive Bayes Model

## Introduction

This project is motivated by the issue of “Fake News” during the 2016 presidential election of the U.S., when “the rise of significantly biased and/or untrue news” influenced the election. This issue then generates the task to distinguish the fake news from the real ones based on the information provided from the title and the text body of the news.

The project aims to build a classification model whose input would be processed data generated from the news title and text, and the output of the model would be the classification of the news, “Fake” or “Real”. Therefore, this project also serves as a practice in “text mining”, where specific data processing has been accomplished to transform text to variables that the classification model could built on.

This project was done as part of the Data Mining for Business Analytics class taught by Prof. Stephen Powell at the Tuck School of Business. Lei Han, my fellow classmate in the Master of Engineering Management program at Dartmouth, worked along with me on this project.
